  <Abstract>
    The &aaa; package is a &GAP; package containing methods for transducers that
    can be represented as asynchronous automata. It builds on the ideas
    presented by Grigorchuk, Nekrashevich, and Sushanskii <Cite Key="GNS"/>, and
    then goes deeper to explore automorphisms via dynamics for the Higman groups
    as exposed by Bleak, Cameron, Maissel, Navas, and Olukoya
    <Cite Key="BCMNO"/>.
    <P/>

  <Acknowledgements>
    The current package is a complete rewrite of the original AAA package that
    was developed by Plamena Mineva-Sholz, Angela Richardson, and Ieva Vasiljeva
    under the supervision of Collin Bleak. This version has been structured
    following the &Semigroups; <Cite Key="SEMIGPS"/> package, a very useful
    recommendation of J. D. Mitchell, and contains all the functionality of the
    previous version, and more.<P/>

    Special thanks to Michael Torpey and Wilf Wilson for their continuous
    support. Their ample knowledge about &GAP; and programming has made the
    development of this package run smoothly.<P/>

    Manuel Delgado and Attila Egri-Nagy contributed to the function
    <Ref Func = "Splash"/>. The function <Ref Oper="DotTransducer"/>, written by
    Michael Torpey, is based on the &Digraphs; <Cite Key="DGPHS"/> package
    function they wrote called DotString.<P/>
