   An introduction to asynchronous automata
  </Heading>
  This package grew out of a desire to be able to work efficiently with elements of the asychronous rational group as described in the paper <Cite Key = "GNS"/>. We will give a brief description of that group here, and give an example in the next subsection of implementing the main processes of the package.
